Here are a couple of eBooks.  They should be easy to read on a smartphone.  They are works-in-progress and will be continually updated.  

[Nephromaths](/books/NEPHROMATHS/index.html): a quick-reference guide to electrolyte and acid-base disorders.  

[LATINART](/books/LATINART/index.html): a list of **LA**ndmark **T**rials **I**n **N**ephrology **A**nd **R**enal **T**ransplant.
