<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We (with Matt Bailey and Bean Dhaun) recently wrote a <a href="INSERT%20LINK">review article</a> on salt and disease. This was an entertaining and highly educational process; I learnt loads!</p>
<p>Here I reflect on what I learned when writing the review and try to distill out the most useful “clinical pearls” relating to salt.</p>
<p>As all of the following is discussed in detail and fully referenced in our paper, I have not inserted references below.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>But first, what do we say in our review? Briefly…</p>
<p>Salt (NaCl) reduction lowers blood pressure and prevents cardiovascular disease. Ditto K supplementation.</p>
<p>Humans exhibit a strong preference for dietary salt because salt activates dopaminergic mesolimbic reward pathways. This drive - plus several socioeconomic barriers to salt reduction - mean that salt reduction interventions have been arguably more effective at a population than an individual level.</p>
<p>How does high salt intake cause hypertension? This is complex; there is a contribution from kidney, vasculature, CNS and the immune system. We discuss the key roles of pressure natriuresis and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).</p>

<div id="the-units-of-salt-are-confusing" class="section level3">
<h3>The units of salt are confusing</h3>
<p>If I were contemplating changing my diet to reduce my risk of cardiovascular disease then I would want to know two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>how much less salt do I need to eat?<br />
</li>
<li>how much will this reduce my risk of stroke and heart attack?</li>
</ol>
<p>We know the answers to both of these questions, but unfortunately it can be really hard to extract this information in a meaningful way from a literature that flits between grams NaCl, grams Na and mmoles. We need first to know how to interconvert these units, and how to put them into some sort of meaningful context.</p>
<p>For sodium, the unit equivalents are as follows: 100 mmol Na = 2.3 g Na = 6g NaCl. To put these in context, a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/big-mac.html">Big Mac</a> = 1000 mg Na; <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sandwiches-and-wraps/sainsburys-chicken-salad-sandwich">Chicken sandwhich</a> = 600 mg Na; packet of crisps = 500 mg Na. And for a table showing the electrolyte content of various medications and IV fluids, see <a href="INSERT%20LINK">chapter 3 of <em>Nephromaths</em></a>.</p>
<p>For potassium: 100 mmol K = 3.9 g K. <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/food-sources-potassium">K content in foods</a>: baked potato (skin on) = 1000 mg; banana or glass or orange juice = 500 mg. K <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/potassium.htm">mainly in</a> in fruit, veg, seafood, dairy.</p>
<p>The context is important because the units we usually use (g and mmoles) are not easy for us to understand intuitively. Wouldn’t it be better to measure salt in “bags-of-crisps” equivalents? Or even better - as most dietary salt is consumed “hidden” in processed foods that are perhaps not immediately perceived as salty <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/sodium-sources">(bread, pizza, sandwiches, processed meats, soups…)</a> - we could use the “commerically-prepared-sandwhich-equivalent” as our standard unit of salt. This equates to approximately 666 mg sodium. Similarly, we could use the “banana-equivalent” as our standard unit of potassium (c. 500 mg).</p>
<p>Therefore, recommended daily Na = less than 5 g NaCl = 2 g Na = 86 mmol = 4 packets of crisps or 500 ml 0.9% NaCl or 1 tsp table salt.</p>
<p>Therefore, recommended daily K = more than 3.5 g K = 90 mmmol = 7 bananas.</p>

<h3>Effect sizes</h3>
<p>If I were contemplating changing my diet to improve my cardiovascular health, I would want to know how much of an impact I could make on my risk of stroke or heart attack, and how many packets of crisps I would have to swap for bananas to achieve this.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>50 mM Na reduction = 2.0 - 2.5 mmHg drop in ABP; mean is 4 mmHg (c.f. 5 mmHg for a drug)… = 10% RRR in CVS disease</p></li>
<li><p>…but RCTs of short duration and perhaps hard to sustain over weeks (effects smaller over 3 - 6 months+) - what does this mean in terms of Big Macs? - plant-based, fresh food better</p></li>
<li><p>gradient higher if older, non-white, hypertensive (and probably also DM - animal studies); salt-sensitivity of ABP in CKD and also slower to re-equilibrate to changes in Na load</p></li>
<li><p>K supplementation interventions = 3 mmHg drop in ABP (for 50 mmol supplementation) - a thiazide-like effect?</p></li>
<li><p>salt-substitutes reduced CVS disease</p></li>
<li><p>sodium and calcium transport correlated in the PCT - so sodium reduction should increase PCT Na uptake and PCT Ca uptake (lowering UCa)</p></li>
<li><p>can retrain / reset thresholds over weeks / months</p></li>
<li><p>eating a healthy diet requires knowledge, time and money - a strong argument for population-level intervention</p></li>
<li><p>amiloride might help to limit salt intake (read the study - complex!)</p></li>
