<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Salt reduction lowers blood pressure and prevents CVD. Ditto K supplementation. More effective at a population than an individual level. Contribution from kidney, vasculature, CNS, immune system - but primacy of pressure natriuresis and the RAAS. Salt preference because salt activates dopaminergic mesolimbic reward pathways.</p>

<div id="the-units-of-salt" class="section level3">
<h3>The units of salt</h3>
<p>100 mmol Na = 2.3 g Na = 6g NaCl
100 mmol K = 3.9 g K</p>
<p>…and link to nephromaths page for meds etc.</p>
<p>Recommended daily Na = less than 5 g NaCl = 2 g Na = 86 mmol = 4 packets of crisps or 500 ml 0.9% NaCl or 1 tsp table salt.<br />
Na <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/sodium-sources">mainly in</a> bread, pizza, sandwiches, processed meats, soups. <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/big-mac.html">Big Mac</a> = 1000 mg; packet of crisps = 500 mg.</p>
<p>Recommended daily K = more than 3.5 g K = 90 mmmol = 7 bananas
<a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/food-sources-potassium">K content in foods</a>: baked potato (skin on) = 1000 mg; banana or glass or orange juice = 500 mg. K <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/potassium.htm">mainly in</a> in fruit, veg, seafood, dairy.</p>

<h3>Others</h3>
<ul>
<li>50 mM Na reduction = 2.0 - 2.5 mmHg drop in ABP; mean is 4 mmHg (c.f. 5 mmHg for a drug)… = 10% RRR in CVS disease<br />
</li>
<li>…but RCTs of short duration and perhaps hard to sustain over weeks (effects smaller over 3 - 6 months+) - what does this mean in terms of Big Macs? - plant-based, fresh food better<br />
</li>
<li>gradient higher if older, non-white, hypertensive (and probably also DM - animal studies); salt-sensitivity of ABP in CKD and also slower to re-equilibrate to changes in Na load<br />
</li>
<li>K supplementation interventions = 3 mmHg drop in ABP - a thiazide-like effect?<br />
</li>
<li>salt-substitutes reduced CVS disease<br />
</li>
<li>sodium and calcium transport correlated in the PCT - so sodium reduction should increase PCT Na uptake and PCT Ca uptake (lowering UCa)<br />
</li>
<li>can retrain / reset thresholds over weeks / months<br />
</li>
<li>eating a healthy diet requires knowledge, time and money - a strong argument for population-level intervention</li>
<li>amiloride might help to limit salt intake (read the study - complex!)</li>
