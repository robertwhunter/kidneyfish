## In this post...

- Why we have a blood pressure

Need to look at notes (and figures) from 2022 slides.  


## Summary

I=V/R
Q=dP/R


Remember Ohm’s law?  (Darcy’s law broadly analogous if talking about pressure and flow in fluids).  

Key driver was evolutionary advantage of higher metabolic rate (high in mammals – can run; higher in birds – can fly!)

Evolution of highish blood pressure – 4 things to consider:
increased metabolic rate (and endothermy) = need for higher O2 delivery = higher Q
reduction in capillary size (so can have increased density and better O2 delivery) = higher R ….therefore dP must also increase
required development of a parallel pulmonary circulation (otherwise tissue oedema limiting gas exchange)
…and also requirement to overcome gravity (next slide)


Dinosaurs and snakes

Everybody remembers Giraffes (MAP 200 – 250 mmHg at heart level c.f. 100 mmHg for most other mammals).  

But snakes also interesting.  

Compare aquatic, terrestrial and arboreal (tree-dwelling) also known as scansorial (climbing) snakes!

Note that tree-climbing snakes have acquired:
a higher ABP
ability to regulate ABP to defend against changes in posture (ABP here measured at level of heart) 

NB Also blog post (?Miller) arguing that this is all to support glomerular filtration.
