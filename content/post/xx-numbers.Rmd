## In this post...

- How hard the renal tubules work
- How close we are to catastrophe
- How rubbish dialysis therapies are

## Assumptions

Number of minutes per day = 1500
Number of minutes per week = 10,000

RBF = 1000 ml/min
GFR = 100 ml/min (makes sense if RPF is 50% of RBF and FF is 20%)

[NaCl] = 140 mM; molecular mass = 58 g/mol

[gluose] = 5 mM; molecular mass = 180 g/mol

<br>

## Implications for tubular work-load

Blood flow: 1500L per day = 10,000L per week

Fluid filtered (and hence reabsorbed): 150L per day = 1000L per week

NaCl fitered: 200 moles = 1.2 kg per day = 8 kg per week

Glucose filtered: 0.75 moles = 135 g per day = 1 kg per week

## Implications for RRT

Assuming Qb of 333 ml/min and 12 hrs HD per week and FF ??

Blood flow = 250L per week = 2.5% native

GFR equivalent = 10 ml/min for dialysis (slightly higher for iHD; slightly lower for PD) or 25 ml/min for cKRRT.
