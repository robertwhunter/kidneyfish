<p>I enjoy teaching and talking about renal physiology. However there is a point around 20 minutes into every teaching session when I can feel a sense of polite detachment floating â€¦</p>
<p>Whenever I am in the midst of a teaching session on renal physiology, I am frequently transported back to</p>
<p>All the things on my slide PLUS - knowing the mechanism gives confidence in it being true (give solute restriction in DI as example).</p>
<p>Also do a post on the 5 implications of the UOsm equation. When UOsm is fixed (ADH, furosemide, DI) - then V set by OL. Move from appendix of nephromaths to blog post and add in DI.</p>
