<p>Physicists may still be searching for the grand unified <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything">theory of everything</a>, but nephrologists have come pretty close to a unified theory of urine. One very simple relationship can be used to explore an impressive array of renal / electrolyte phenomena. It is such a simple relationship that it’s simplicy belies its utility - and for that reason it could reasonably be called the “E = mc<sup>2</sup> of nephrology.”</p>
<p>It is the <a href="https://kidneyfish-nephromaths.netlify.app/water-and-sodium.html#UOsm">relationship</a> between osmolar load (OL), urine volume (V) and urine osmolality (U<sub>Osm</sub>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V  = \frac{OL}{U_{Osm}}\]</span></p>
<p>This equation has at least six corollaries.</p>

<div id="corollary-1-drinking-seawater-causes-dehydration" class="section level2">
<h2>Corollary 1: drinking seawater causes dehydration</h2>
<p>The osmolality of seawater is <a href="https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&amp;id=100802&amp;ver=5">~1000 mOsm/kg</a>. Imagine 1L of seawater is ingested by somebody whose kidneys are only able to concentrate urine to a maximum of 900 mOsm/kg. The osmolar load (1000 mOsm) must then be excreted in a minimum of 1.11L of urine (=1000/900), leading to a net loss of 0.11L of free water from the body.</p>

<h2>Corollary 2: giving 0.9% NaCl can exacerbate hyponatraemia in some circumstances</h2>
<p>Hyponatraemia may occur in the context of <code>unregulated ADH release</code> (e.g. SiADH or profound volume depletion). In this context, urine osmolality is fixed so as to generate a concentrated urine. Suppose hyponatraemia develops in a person in whom ADH activation sets U<sub>Osm</sub> at 600 mOsm/kg. If we were to administer 1L of intravenous 0.9% NaCl (=150 mM), this would deliver an osmolar load of 300 mOsm. This load would be excreted in 0.5L of urine, leaving 0.5L of free water in the body to exacerbate the hyponatraemia. For this reason, hypertonic saline is usually required in the treatment of severe or symptomatic hyponatraemia.</p>

<div id="corollaries-3-4-calculating-the-water-intake-required-to-cause-hyponatraemia-and-ditto-on-furosemide" class="section level2">
<h2>Corollaries 3 &amp; 4: Calculating the water intake required to cause hyponatraemia (and ditto on furosemide)</h2>
<p>Hyponatraemia is a problem of excess body water. In normal circumstances - i.e. with completely normal renal function and an intact ADH axis - the kidney is able to respond to water challange by producing a dilute urine. The minimum possible urine osmolality will be ~50 mOsm/kg. A typical <code>daily osmolar load</code> is around 10 mOsm per kg body weight (for somebody taking a Western diet); therefore ~700 mOsm in a 70 kg person.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{daily osmole excretion }  = 10 {\text{ mOsm} \times \text{kg body weight}}\]</span></p>
<p>This load can be accompanied by a free water intake of anything up to 14L per day (700/50), and that water can still be excreted in a urine that might be as dilute as 50 mOsm/kg. However, any water intake exceeding this threshold cannot be excreted and would be retained as free water, resulting in hyponatraemia.</p>
<p>Therefore it should be apparent that in normal circumstances, the volume of water required to generated hyponatraemia through polydipsia is remarkably high (~14L per day). However, in many patients who are unwell and may have low dietary solute intake and / or some limit to renal water excretion (e.g. mild CKD) then drinking a relatively low volume of water might result in hyponatraemia. If daily solute intake = 350 mOsm and U<sub>Osm</sub> cannot be lowered beyond 100 mOsm/kg then water intake in excess of 3.5L per day (350/100) would cause hyponatraemia.</p>
<p>One patient group worthy of consideration are those patients taking <code>loop diuretics</code>. In these individuals, U<sub>Osm</sub> will be <a href="/post/diuretics-and-water-one/index.html">fixed at ~300 mOsm/L</a>. Therefore, assuming an osmolar load of 700 mOsmoles, any water intake exceeding ~2.3L per day risks inciting hyponatraemia. It is usually sensible to institute a water restriction alongside any furosemide prescription.</p>

<div id="corollary-5-poor-diet-low-dietary-solute-intake-can-cause-hyponatraemia" class="section level2">
<h2>Corollary 5: Poor diet (low dietary solute intake) can cause hyponatraemia</h2>
<p>When dietary solute intake is low, the volume of urine used to excrete that osmolar load will also be low (for any given U<sub>Osm</sub>). This may limit water excretion, resulting in hyponatraemia.</p>
<p>A diet that is relatively rich in carbohydrate will be low in solutes: carbohydrate is metabolised to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, whereas protein is metabolised to urea. Thus hyponatraemia arising from this mechanism is commonly encountered in <code>beer potomania</code> and in patients on a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9631849/">“tea and toast diet”</a>.</p>

<div id="corollary-6" class="section level2">
<h2>Corollary 6:</h2>
<p>In health, U<sub>Osm</sub> is <em>dynamic</em>: our kidneys set a urine concentration that is appropriate to maintain water homeostasis. When U<sub>Osm</sub> is fixed, then V is determined by osmolar load.</p>
<p>Above, we considered two potential implications of a <em>fixed</em> U<sub>Osm</sub>. U<sub>Osm</sub> may be fixed a some high level when ADH is present or at a middling-level when furosemide is acting. But what about when U<sub>Osm</sub> is fixed low (i.e. dilute urine)? This is most commonly encountered in <code>diabetes insipidus</code>. In this context, limiting dietary solute intake should help to reduce urine volumes. This can be a helpful part of management in patients with - for example - previous lithium exposure.</p>
