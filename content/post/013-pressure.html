<h2>In this post…</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why we have a blood pressure</li>
</ul>
<p>Need to look at notes (and figures) from 2022 slides.</p>
<p>Main point is that we can either have low-pressure, low-resistance system or high-P, high-R and we have the latter because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>physical constraints on R</li>
<li>need for GFR</li>
<li>allows shunting in parallel bed</li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I=V/R
Q=dP/R</p>
<p>Remember Ohm’s law? (Darcy’s law broadly analogous if talking about pressure and flow in fluids).</p>
<p>Key driver was evolutionary advantage of higher metabolic rate (high in mammals – can run; higher in birds – can fly!)</p>
<p>Evolution of highish blood pressure – 4 things to consider:
increased metabolic rate (and endothermy) = need for higher O2 delivery = higher Q
reduction in capillary size (so can have increased density and better O2 delivery) = higher R ….therefore dP must also increase
required development of a parallel pulmonary circulation (otherwise tissue oedema limiting gas exchange)
…and also requirement to overcome gravity (next slide)</p>
<p>Dinosaurs and snakes</p>
<p>Everybody remembers Giraffes (MAP 200 – 250 mmHg at heart level c.f. 100 mmHg for most other mammals).</p>
<p>But snakes also interesting.</p>
<p>Compare aquatic, terrestrial and arboreal (tree-dwelling) also known as scansorial (climbing) snakes!</p>
<p>Note that tree-climbing snakes have acquired:
a higher ABP
ability to regulate ABP to defend against changes in posture (ABP here measured at level of heart)</p>
<p>NB Also blog post (?Miller) arguing that this is all to support glomerular filtration.</p>
