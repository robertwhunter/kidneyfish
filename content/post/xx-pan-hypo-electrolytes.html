<p>One referral that is always a bit of a head-scratcher is the patient with low Na, low K, low Mg, low PO4 - what could reasonably be called <code>pan-hypo-electrolytes</code>. This is a pretty common scenario in hospitalised patients - and we’ll come to the differential diagnosis in a subsequent post.</p>
<p>But first to the problem of interpreting urinary electrolytes in such a case. We were recently involved in a patient with widespread electrolyte deficiencies. At first glance, a standard number-crunching approach suggested that the hypokalaemia was due to renal K loss (UK and TTKG inappropriately high). But the Mg was low also - and we are not too surprised about that because everybody learns in medical school that Mg deficiency can cause refractory hypokalaemia.</p>
<p>But don’t we need to know the mechanism? If the mechanism resides in the renal tubules, then we could blame the inappropriately high renal K secretion on a primary Mg disorder.</p>
