## In this post...

- Why we need to know about renal physiology  

I enjoy teaching and talking about renal physiology.  However there is a point around 20 minutes into every teaching session when I can feel a sense of polite detachment floating ...

All the things on my slide PLUS - knowing the mechanism gives confidence in it being true (give solute restriction in DI as example).  

THings on slide were:  
- electrolyte disorders are renal disorders  
- other people will ask you about this  
- easy to get confused  
- dangerous to blindly crunch numbers (prinicples more important )  
- no RCTs and not likely to be  
- best bit of renal medicine!
