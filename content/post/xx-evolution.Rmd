## In this post...

- How our kidneys have been shaped by evolution  
- How we retain ancient mechanisms to defend against acidosis  


## Notes

For some nice phylogenetic trees of vertebrate evolution see:

Need to put in context of geological scale  

May need to combine or annotate these to form one perfect master-image!  

Ammonigenesis retained in PCTs - is the simplest of the nitrogenous compounds  

Re-read evolution of ABP paper and also 2024 Nat Rev Urology article
