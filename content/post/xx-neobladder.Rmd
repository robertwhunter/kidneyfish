## Complications of urinary diversion

The complications from urinary diversion arise because the intestinal epithelium (usually ileum or colon) used to fashion a neobladder expresses solute transporters that are potentially unhelpful in a bladder.  Intestinal epithelial cells express [Cl-HCO3 exhangers](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.eux.idm.oclc.org/17556426/) and [NH4 transporters (Rhcg, Rhbg)](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.eux.idm.oclc.org/15576624/).  DRA = “downregulated in adenoma”: luminal Cl / HCO3 exchanger.  Therefore, when exposed to chloride-rich urine, chloride-bicarbonate exchangers can drive bicarbonate wasting.  When ammonium production is high (e.g. in the presence of urea-splitting organisms), ammonium transporters can drive hyperammonaemia.

The complications of neobladder formation are nicely reviewed in an [AJKD Core Curriculum article](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.eux.idm.oclc.org/33972146/).  

The include:  

- diarrhoea (from malabsorption / bacterial overgrowth)... ...which could cause a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis or a D-lactic metabolic acidosis  
- hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis from chloride-bicarbonate exchange in the bladder (ileal and colonic neobladders)  
- hypokalaemic alkalosis (gastric neobladders – no longer used)  
- hypoNa / hyperK (jejunal conduits – attributed to secondary hyperaldosteronism)  
- hyperammonaemic encephalopathy (ileal and colonic neobladders)  
- urolithiasis (typically triple phosphate = Struvite stones from urea-splitting organisms / chronic acidosis)  
- osteomalacia  
- drug toxicity due to re-absorption from urine (phytoin / methotrexate…)  
- exaggerated hyperglycaemia with absent glycosuria

## Hyperammonaemic encephalopathy

The most devastating poential complication is hyperammonaemic encephalopathy.  Infection or colonisation with urea-splitting organisms (Proteus, Klebsiella, Morganella...) will result in urinary ammonium production.  This can be absorbed across the neobladder epithlium, leading to high systemic levels causing encepalopathy and coma.  

The core principles of management are:  

- ensure urinary drainage (e.g. insert urinary catheter)  
- prompt, appropriate antibiotics  
- correct hypokalaemia (will drive renal tubular ammoniagenesis)  
- lactulose / low protein diet / possibly neomycin (as for hepatic encephalopathy)  
- consider haemodialysis for rapid ammonium removal
