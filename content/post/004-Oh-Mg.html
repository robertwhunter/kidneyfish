<h2>PPIs and Mg</h2>
<p>We had a referral recently for a case of persistent hypomagnesaemia “? cause”. As is often the case, the patient had been taking a PPI for some years. There was no obvious alternative explanation and FE<sub>Mg</sub> was low - so we blamed this as the likely culprit. But was this just lazy? It was a prompt to review the literature regarding the strength of the association between PPI use and hypomagnesaemia and the underlying molecular mechanism.</p>

<h2>Do PPIs cause hypomagnesaemia?</h2>
<p>PPIs are taken by millions world-wide are generally pretty safe. We know from RCTs such as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152740">COMPASS trial</a> that adverse effects are relatively rare, but that PPIs do cause a small increase in the risk of enteric infections.</p>
<p>There is an association between PPI use and hypomagnesaemia: an association that is potentiated by concomitant use of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23325090">diuretics</a>. Although rooted in observational data, this association has been replicated in different populations and a compelling argument for a causative role PPIs comes from cases in which the hypomagnesaemia responds to PPI withdrawal and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762246">re-challenge</a>. (Interestingly in these reports, hypomagnesaemia resolved surprisingly promptly - only a few days - after PPI withdrawal.)</p>

<div id="what-is-the-mechanism" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the mechanism?</h2>
<p>So what is the mechanism? Is it due to reduced intestinal absorption or increased renal excretion? We know that the kidney - and in particular the DCT - plays a crucial role in regulating Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and that drugs that perturb renal Mg<sup>2</sup> handling can cause hypomagnesaemia. Mg<sup>2+</sup> is re-absorbed through apical <code>TRPM6</code> channels in DCT cells - and mutations in this channel cause hypomagnesaemia with secondary hypocalcaemia. This system is regulated by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17671655">epidermal growth factor</a> (<code>EGF</code>), which binds to basolateral receptors, stimulating TRPM6 activity.</p>
<div id="effect-of-anti-cancer-therapies-diruretics-and-cnis" class="section level3">
<h3>Effect of anti-cancer therapies, diruretics and CNIs</h3>
<p>In oncology, antibody and small-molecule <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20595681">inhibitors of EGF</a> can promote renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> loss for obvious reasons. Platinum-based agents - such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/375794">cisplatin</a> - can induce profound and very long-lasting renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> wasting. This is thought to be due to cisplatin accumulating within, and then killing, tubular cells.</p>
<p>Although the DCT is responsible for ‘fine-tuning’ renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> excretion, the bulk of filtered Mg<sup>2+</sup> is reabsorbed passively though a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17671646">paracellular route</a> in the PCT and TALH. Therefore loop diuretics - which diminish the driving force for this re-absorption - can also cause renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> wasting. Tacrolimus can promote renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> loss by reducing tubular TRPM6 expression <em>via</em> a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31908154">calcineurin-dependent pathway</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="mechanism-of-ppi-induced-hypomagnesaemia" class="section level3">
<h3>Mechanism of PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia</h3>
<p>PPIs, on the other hand, do not appear to promote renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> wasting. In fact urinary Mg<sup>2+</sup> excretion is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538697">appropriately reduced</a> in cases of PPI-associated hypomagnesaemia. So the effect is presumably mediated through reduced intestinal absorption but the molecular mechanism has yet to be determined. The intestinal absorption of Mg<sup>2+</sup> is predominantly through TRPM6 and TRPM7 channels. In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16636202">heterologous expression systems</a>, the activity of these channels is pH-dependent, with higher inward currents being observed under acid conditions. Therefore it seems plausible that PPIs, by promoting an alkaline intestinal environment, might reduce Mg<sup>2+</sup> absorption.</p>
<!-- However - some authors propose what appears to be the opposite!  PPIs cause a fall in intestinal pH, which is [thought](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23051182) to reduce the affinity of TRPM6/7 channels for Mg^2+^, resulting in reduced intestinal absorption.  -->
