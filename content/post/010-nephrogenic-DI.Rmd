### Move all this to this thiazide one

## Off-target effects

However, this model is over-simplistic.  One additional factor at play is that thiazide diuretics can exert an "off-target" inhibition of `carbonic anhydrase` in the proximal tubule.  This will inhibit sodium reabsorption through the sodium-bicarbonate exchanger and thus shift sodium re-absorption to the water-impermeable distal tubule, where sodium reabsorption favours water excretion.  

Hence why...
...but evidence from NCC null mouse
...and the prostaglandin story (Glover)
