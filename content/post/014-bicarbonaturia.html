<h2>How is renal bicarbonate excretion regulated?</h2>
<p>With respect to bicarbonate reabsorption, there are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16695919/">two key parameters</a> to consider: the Tm = maximal rate of tubular HCO<sub>3</sub> reabsoption and the renal bicarbonate threshold = the serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] at which the filtered load exceeds Tm, and bicarbonate begins to appear in the urine.</p>
<p>There is an <em>apparent</em> Tm for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, setting a tubular threshold close to 25 mM but this is variable and influenced by various factors (GFR, luminal pH, hormonal factors etc.) For example, during volume depletion, stimulation of Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption (NHE activity) will increase HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> re-absorption, so leading to an increase in the apparent Tm for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. (See below for an explanation on why this is an “apparent” Tm.)</p>

<div id="the-pathogenesis-of-proximal-rta" class="section level2">
<h2>The pathogenesis of proximal RTA</h2>
<p>The best way to think about pRTA is to view this as a reduction in the Tm for bicarbonate (and therefore renal bicarbonate threshold).</p>
<p>The mechanisms responsible for proximal and distal RTAs were investigated by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6059425/">Edelman and co-workers in 1967</a>, and their explanation has not been bettered since (although our understanding of renal bicarbonate has been refined). They studied bicarbonate reabsorption in children during continuous NaHCO<sub>3</sub> infusion, and H<sup>+</sup> excretion in spontaneous acidosis and during treatment with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.</p>
<p>H<sup>+</sup> excretion was studied by measuring urinary pH. HCO<sub>3</sub> reabsorption was studied by determining the Tm and bicarbonate threshold.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="healthy-response" class="section level3">
<h3>Healthy response</h3>
<p>In healthy children, the renal bicarbonate threshold is 22 - 24 mM (and in adults, 24 - 28 mM).</p>
<p>Above this threshold, almost all secreted H+ is buffered by HCO<sub>3</sub> in the renal tubular fluid - i.e. diverted to facilitating HCO<sub>3</sub> reabsorption. A few mM below this threshold, sufficient H<sup>+</sup> become available for acidifying urine and facilitating titratable acid and NH<sub>4</sub> excretion. Therefore, the normal response to a metabolic acidosis is to generate an acid urine, so that when serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] falls below 22 - 24 mM, the urine pH drops progressively from alkaline (7.5 - 8.0), reaching maximal acidification with pH &lt;&lt; 5.5 when serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] falls below 18 - 20 mM.</p>
<p><br></p>

<div id="prta-type-ii" class="section level3">
<h3>pRTA (type II)</h3>
<p>In children with pRTA, there is a reduction in Tm and therefore in the renal bicarbonate threshold (to 15 - 20 mM). Therefore, when [HCO<sub>3</sub>] is in this range of 15 - 20 mM, there are significant quantities of HCO<sub>3</sub> in the distal tubular fluid so that any secreted protons are buffered and the urinary pH remains alkaline. Once serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] falls below the renal bicarbonate threshold, secreted protons are free to acidify the urine. Therefore these children can still generate acid urine (pH &lt; 5.5 with high titratable acid and NH<sub>4</sub> excretion) but there is a left-shift in the urinary pH-serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] curve.</p>
<p>(In the original Edelman series, there was one exception who could not fully acidify the urine: a patient with Fanconi syndrome in whom hypophosphaturia limited the renal excretion of titratable acid.)</p>
<p>There is a homeostatic feedback loop inherent in a relatively fixed renal bicarbonate threshold: an alkaline urine is generated when serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] rises; an acid urine is permitted as serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] falls. This explains why blood pH settles at around the renal HCO<sub>3</sub> threshold. Because acid excretion is still possible, the metabolic / skeletal phenotype in pRTA is never so severe as in dRTA.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="drta-type-i" class="section level3">
<h3>dRTA (type I)</h3>
<p>In children with dRTA, there is no change in the Tm or renal bicarbonate threshold. However, these children are unable to acidify the urine, even in the context of a profound metabolic acidosis. Urine pH is always &gt;&gt; 6.5 and there are markedly reduced rates of titratable acid / NH<sub>4</sub> excretion. As they are in a state of constant +ve proton balance, they exhibit a profound metabolic / skeletal phenotype.</p>

<h2>The pathophysiology of vomiting</h2>
<p>The above simplistic model is helpful when understanding pRTA. However, it falls down in explanations of metabolic alkalosis. How can a metabolic alkalosis be sustained it excess HCO<sub>3</sub> would simply be filtered and not reabsorbed as serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] rises progressively above the renal threshold?</p>
<p>We should therefore refine our simplistic model in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>the Tm for HCO<sub>3</sub> would be better termed an <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6401477-principles-of-renal-physiology">“apparent Tm”</a> because of course the urinary HCO<sub>3</sub> content is determined not only by “spillover” from the PCT but also by HCO<sub>3</sub> secretion in the CD (beta-ICs) and by H<sup>+</sup> secretion (alpha-ICs);</p></li>
<li><p>the Tm for HCO<sub>3</sub> (and by extension the renal HCO<sub>3</sub> threshold) is not fixed; for example it varies in response to changes in volume status, GFR, luminal pH, hormonal signalling…</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis, divided into generation, maintenance and recovery phases, was first described by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4600132/">Seldin &amp; Rector in 1972</a>. They point out that when large doses of HCO<sub>3</sub> are administered to healthy individuals, this does not induce a metabolic alkalosis - precisely because the steady-state serum [HCO<sub>3</sub>] sits so close to the tubular threshold for HCO<sub>3</sub>. Therefore in vomiting / diuretic-induced alkalosis etc. there must be additional renal mechanisms to sustain the alkalosis. These mechanisms <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35525634/">include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>hypochloraemia and hence low distal tubular chloride delivery, impairing HCO<sub>3</sub> secretion via pendrin in beta-ICs<br />
</li>
<li>volume depletion leading to enhanced NaHCO<sub>3</sub> reabsorption in the PCT<br />
</li>
<li>volume depletion leading to RAS activation and enhance mineralocorticoid activity in the distal nephron (favouring electrogenic Na reabsorption with H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> secretion)<br />
</li>
<li>hypokalaemia stimulating ammoniagenesis (and therefore HCO<sub>3</sub> generation) in the PCT and altering expression of various PCT and CD transporters including pendrin to favour HCO<sub>3</sub> reabsorption and impair HCO<sub>3</sub> secretion<br />
</li>
<li>increased distal delivery of Na<sup>+</sup> (e.g. with loop diuretics) - favouring electrogenic Na+ resorption</li>
</ul>
<p>The hypochloraemia / pendrin effect is likely dominant because chloride repletion has been shown to be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22223876/">necessary and sufficient</a> for correcting metabolic alkalosis.</p>

<h2>Clinical implications after vomiting</h2>
<p>The clinical implications are that after vomiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>bicarbonaturia can drive renal losses of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> - leading to hypokalaemia…<br />
</li>
<li>resolution of the alkalosis is only achieved by replacing chloride (e.g with generous IV NaCl)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is the potential for confusion because U<sub>Na</sub> may be high (in contrast to other hypovolaemic states) and U<sub>K</sub> may be high (in contrast to hypokalaemia in the context of lower GI losses).</p>
<p>The test of choice, therefore, to differentiate between purging and salt-losing tubulopathy (e.g. in unexplained hypokalaemic alkalosis) is a urinary chloride; FE<sub>Cl</sub> is &lt; 0.5% after vomiting.</p>
