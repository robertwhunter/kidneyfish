## In this post...

- What to do when everything is low  
- Refeeding syndrome  
- Acquired Bartter syndrome  

One referral that is always a bit of a head-scratcher is the patient with low Na, low K, low Mg, low PO4 - what could reasonably be called `pan-hypo-electrolytes`.  This is a pretty common scenario in hospitalised patients - and we'll come to the differential diagnosis in a subsequent post.    

But first to the problem of interpreting urinary electrolytes in such a case.  We were recently involved in a patient with widespread electrolyte deficiencies.  At first glance, a standard number-crunching approach suggested that the hypokalaemia was due to renal K loss (UK and TTKG inappropriately high).  But the Mg was low also - and we are not too surprised about that because everybody learns in medical school that Mg deficiency can cause refractory hypokalaemia.  

But don't we need to know the mechanism?  If the mechanism resides in the renal tubules, then we could blame the inappropriately high renal K secretion on a primary Mg disorder.
