Welcome to my blog.  I write about aspects of renal physiology that are relevant to clinical medicine.  For an explanation of the title and a summary of the aims of this blog see [my first post](/post/first-post/index.html).  I also use this site to host a few [eBooks](/ebooks/index.html).  

The site is designed to look best on a smartphone.

## The science behind the art of medicine:

- medicine = diagnosis, treatment, communication - in the broadest terms  

- understanding Bayesian statistics - pre-test probability and liklihood ratios
- understanding stats - not just p-values (i.e. point estimate and effect size more important)  
- understanding the RCT (i.e. magic of randomisation)
- acceptable non-adherance  
- cognitive biases (e.g. behavioural heurisitics in CABG, NEJM 2020)  
- know the mechanism (e.g. DKA in anuria - because 1. never exact fit for protocol / RCT and understanding mechanisms can deviate from these; 2. interesting; 3. research)  
- art is to simplify (e.g. problem list video)  
- RCT paper (Collins and Peto, NEJM 2020): Value of RCTs - example of cancer and CVS risk and statins in Danish cohort / Masking...
...RCT > RRR > is this likely to be different? (sometimes it is e.g. statins in HD) > apply to population AR

Use animal / in vitro models when RCT not feasible in humans to prove causation and to untangle molecular mechanism etc.  Role of Mendelian randomisation studies.  

## OR Covid-19 as microcosm:
- limitations of medicine (Larry weed; proning; family)
- molecular medicine (evolutionary tree) / RCTs (proning)
- value of RCT = fallacy of compassionate use
- Bayeseian fallacy (move to +ve zone if neg and repeating)  
- why leave logic when panic?

![Larry Weed's grand round](http://www.gregoryschmidt.ca/writing/dr-larry-weeds-1971-lecture)
"The way you handle the data determines the way you think." - parallel with Schimel - clear writing fuels clear thinking  
"Don't play Sherlock Holmes too early" - have to establish a comprehensive database (e.g. full history, basic labs) before attempting any deduction - or else will go down wrong path.  
"God and the chiropracters will cure 90% of patients; the only reason we have hospitals is to catch the final 10%".  
Use definite "problems" defined at the level of certainty (could be a physiological finding or a symptom rather than a diagnosis); avoid "impressions" - subjective (would have to have the doctor who wrote it with you to interpret the meaning!)
"The sickest kidney is smarter than the brightest intern"
Doctors as guidance systems in an uncertain world - NOT definitive oracles - hence the requirement for good data
Do the thinking BEFORE ordering the test
