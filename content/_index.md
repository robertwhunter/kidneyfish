Welcome to my blog.  I write about aspects of renal physiology that are relevant to clinical medicine.  For an explanation of the title and a summary of the aims of this blog see [my first post](/post/first-post/index.html).  I also use this site to host a few [eBooks](/ebooks/index.html).  

The site is designed to look best on a smartphone.  

<!-- FUTURE POSTS
