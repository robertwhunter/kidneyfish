      <description>In this post…  Why we need to know about renal physiology  I enjoy teaching and talking about renal physiology. However there is a point around 20 minutes into every teaching session when I can feel a sense of polite detachment floating …
All the things on my slide PLUS - knowing the mechanism gives confidence in it being true (give solute restriction in DI as example).
THings on slide were:</description>

      <description>In this post…  How to assess free water balance in the dysnatraemias
 How to factor in solute / cation balance   “There’s more than one way to skin a cat.”

 So the proverb goes. But that is only because whoever came up with the proverb back in the 19th century had never attempted to assess free water balance in a case of hyponatraemia.

      <description>“Renal physiology has now passed into a quantitative phase where unsupported speculation and empirical description are no longer warranted.”
— Homer Smith, 1951
 In this post…  What are the aims of this blog?
 Where does the name come from?   Why write a blog? I enjoy learning about renal physiology - in particular those aspects that are relevant to clinical disorders of fluid-electrolyte balance. However I have a bad habit of reading up on a topic, understanding it for 10 minutes, and promptly forgetting it again.</description>
