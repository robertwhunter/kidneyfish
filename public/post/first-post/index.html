<h2>Why write a blog?</h2>
<p>I enjoy learning about renal physiology - in particular those aspects that are relevant to clinical disorders of fluid-electrolyte balance. However I have a bad habit of reading up on a topic, understanding it for 10 minutes, and promptly forgetting it again. I thought that starting a blog might help me to retain information in the longer term. I suspect that this blog will be read by an audience of one, which is fine with me!</p>
</div>
<div id="aims-of-this-blog" class="section level2">
<h2>Aims of this blog</h2>
<p>I intend to use this blog to highlight those facets of <code>renal physiology</code> that are most relevant to <code>clinical medicine</code>. When a clinical case prompts me to read up on something, I will make a short post. (For example, I might review the mechanism of PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia or ask how thiazide diuretics work in diabetes insipius.) I will also write about recent papers and re-vist the “classic” experiments of the early-mid 20th century that allowed us to understand the basic mechanisms of kidney physiology.</p>
<!-- ## What do kidneys do? -->
<!-- The kidneys are often thought of as fancy "filters": cleaning the blood to remove toxins and waste.  In so doing, they determine the composition of the body fluids.  The have therefore been called the ["master chemists"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.a.20017) of the body.   -->
<!-- This is an incredibly complicated job; many inter-related variables must be carefully regulated in order to keep the composition of our body-fluids in balance.  Minute by minute, the kidneys fine-tune their output of water, salts, acids and metabolic waste products; they respond promptly to threats such as changes in diet, vomiting and diarrhoea.  They also play a vital role in controlling other body functions, participating in the control of blood pressure, red blood cell production, bone health and the defence against infection.    -->
<!-- Despite this enormous complexity, we understand - by and large - how the kidneys accomplish all of this.  For that we can thank the many anatomists, physiologists, pharmacologists and physicians who have - over centuries - built a solid foundation in our basic understanding of how kidneys work.   -->
<!-- ## Why write about kidneys? -->
<!-- Many physicians are drawn to careers in renal medicine - and scientists to careers in renal physiology - by an admiration for the sheer elegance of renal physiology.  Homer Smith - whom I shall mention again below - was a master at expressing his such admiration.  And for a succinct expression of why the kidneys we should awestruck by the work of the kidneys, one can do no better than Joel Topf's essay on ["atomic balancing machines"](http://pbfluids.com/2012/03/what-i-love-about-nephrology-and-the-kidneys/).  Without attempting to match either of these great writers, I shall begin this blog by explaining three reasons why I find the kidneys so intriguing.     -->
<!-- First, we can `see` how they work.  Unlike those organs that are made up of a homogenous cell mass -- I'm looking at you liver -- we can infer the function of a kidney from its micro-anatomical structure.  We can [literally see](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25738253) how the blood is filtered in the glomeruli and how the filtrate might be subsequently modified in the renal tubules.  In later blog-posts I will consider the contribution from pioneering anatomists and comparative anatomists (Malpighi, Bowman, Bellini, Henle) and look at the contemporary imaging techniques that allow us to visualise kidney functions in detail.   -->
<!-- Second, we can `measure` how they work.  The basic physiological processes of kidney function - glomerular filtration and tubular transport - can be experimentally quantified.  This might seem like a moot point, but in fact is of enormous importance to all of us.  Patients with kidney disease (and their doctors) can form a firm grasp of how well or how poorly their kidneys are functioning - and the rate at which this is changing.  Scientists can interrogate kidney functions using robust, quantitative experiments.    -->
<!-- Third, we can `describe` how they work.  Despite their sophisticated function, kidneys operate as machines following a set of very simple rules.  These rules have evolved to provide ingenious solutions to the problems that we face from day to day.  For example, one rule is "filter everything then reabsorb selectively".  Kidneys work by blindly filtering most small molecules from the blood and *then* selectively re-claiming what the body needs to keep from this filtrate.  This is a fantastic way of ensuring that the body can get rid of small water-soluble toxins for which we don't possess specific transporters (because we might not have encountered these toxins in our evolutionary history).  We can ingest many man-made drugs without fear of toxicity because our kidneys will be able to excrete them and their metabolites.  Again - I will discuss this in more detail (as well as the other basic "rules" governing kidney function such as glomerulotubular balance and tubulaoglomerular feedback) in later posts.   -->
<!-- ## From Fish To Physician -->
<!-- I have thought about writing a blog for some years - but was always put off by the fear of having nothing of note to say and daunted by the many other excellent bloggers and writers who seem to have nephrology well-and-truly covered.  On the other hand I have been encouraged by reading blogs written by people who are truly passionate about their work - and I suspect that for many people the fun is had in the *writing*; who cares if anybody else ever reads it!  So I thought I would give it a go... -->
<div id="name-of-this-blog" class="section level3">
<h3>Name of this blog</h3>
<p>My interest in renal physiology was - in part - inspired by the “father of renal Physiology”, <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/smith-homer.pdf">Homer Smith</a> and by the scientists who followed in his footsteps.</p>
<center>
<img src="/images/homer.jpg" alt="Homer Smith" style="width:60.0%" />
</center>
<p>As a scientist and writer, he laid the foundations for modern renal physiology. He was amongst the first to describe basic renal processes in robust, quantitative terms. He wrote about how our kidneys have evolved over the past 4 billion years, most famously in his classic book, <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL13506034M/From_fish_to_philosopher">From Fish To Philosopher</a>. Calling this blog <code>From Fish To Physician</code> is a nod to this inspiration. My title takes the evolutionary journey described by Smith one step further than he did. We have evolved to a state where we are able not only to <em>think</em> in general terms but to one in which we understand - by and large - the cellular and molecular basis of electrolyte disorders and kidney diseases.</p>
