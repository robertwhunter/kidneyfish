      <description>In this post…  Why drinking seawater causes dehydration
 Why giving 0.9% NaCl can exacerbate hyponatraemia in some circumstances
 How much water do you have to drink to cause hyponatraemia
 Why most patients on furosemide should also have restricted water intake
 Why a “tea and toast” diet causes hyponatraemia
 Why limiting dietary solute intake can help in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus  Physicists may still be searching for the grand unified theory of everything, but nephrologists have come pretty close to a unified theory of urine.</description>

      <title>When is a diuretic not a diuretic?</title>

      <description>In this post…  The paradoxical anti-diuretic effects of diuretics
 A general approach to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus   When is a tractor not a tractor?
…
When it turns into a field
  Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus As nephrologists, we are often asked for advice on how to manage patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Almost always, this has been caused by current or historic lithium exposure.</description>

      <description>In this post…  Why does low Mg cause low K?
 Distal Na and K transport and the transepithelial voltage  Hypomagnesaemia: easy to find if you go looking for it; usually left well alone. (And often caused by a drug.)
But sometimes hypomagnesaemia is worth paying attention to if it is contributing to another electrolyte disorder such as hypocalcaemia or hypokalaemia. Any medical student can tell you that Mg deficiency can cause refractory hypokalaemia.</description>

      <title>How to assess free water balance in dysnatraemia</title>

      <description>In this post…  How to assess free water balance in the dysnatraemias
 How to factor in solute / cation balance   “There’s more than one way to skin a cat.”
— Proverb
 So the proverb goes. But that is only because whoever came up with the proverb back in the 19th century had never attempted to assess free water balance in a case of hyponatraemia. More than any other electrolyte disorder, hyponatraemia has the capacity to become unneccessarily complicated.</description>

      <title>Should I stop the furosemide?</title>

      <description>In this post…  What effect do loop diuretics have on renal free water clearance?
 Should we stop furosemide in hyponatraemia?
 Why do we need to restrict water intake when giving furosemide in hyponatraemia?  We are mostly water and rapidly run into trouble when we become under- or over-hydrated. We could argue, therefore, that one of the kidney’s most important jobs is that of maintaining water homeostasis.</description>

      <title>Terlipressin and hyponatraemia</title>

      <description>In this post…  The evolution of the vasopressin system
 How can one hormone regulate two physiological parameters (tonicity and blood pressure)?
 Why does terlipressin not always cause profound hyponatraemia?   “Thousands have lived without love, not one without water.”
— WH Auden
  Does terlipressin cause hyponatraemia? We had a patient with hepatorenal syndrome on the unit recently. Her sodium was 125 mM and I found myself wondering - as I always do in such a patient - whether terlipressin could be contributing.</description>

      <description>In this post…  PPIs are associated with hypomagnesaemia
 PPIs reduce intestinal Mg2+ absorption
 diuretics, CNIs and anti-cancer agents promote renal Mg2+ loss   PPIs and Mg We had a referral recently for a case of persistent hypomagnesaemia “? cause”. As is often the case, the patient had been taking a PPI for some years. There was no obvious alternative explanation and FEMg was low - so we blamed this as the likely culprit.</description>

 Potassium supplementation can help in cases of hyponatraemia   What are we made of?  What are little girls made of?

And all things nice
That’s what little girls are made of

      <title>Filtration-reabsorption: the central renal paradox</title>

      <description>In this post…  How the kidney evolved to filter first and reabsorb later
 How we came to know how the kidney works in this way   It is so obvious!  ‘One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.’
— Marie Curie
 As facts become established dogma, it becomes almost impossible to conceive of a time when they were not known.</description>

      <description>“Renal physiology has now passed into a quantitative phase where unsupported speculation and empirical description are no longer warranted.”
— Homer Smith, 1951
 In this post…  What are the aims of this blog?
 Where does the name come from?   Why write a blog? I enjoy learning about renal physiology - in particular those aspects that are relevant to clinical disorders of fluid-electrolyte balance. However I have a bad habit of reading up on a topic, understanding it for 10 minutes, and promptly forgetting it again.</description>
