      <description>In this post…  Summary Clinical pearls   Summary Salt reduction lowers blood pressure and prevents CVD. Ditto K supplementation. More effective at a population than an individual level. Contribution from kidney, vasculature, CNS, immune system - but primacy of pressure natriuresis and the RAAS. Salt preference because salt activates dopaminergic mesolimbic reward pathways.

      <description>In this post…  Why drinking seawater causes dehydration
 Why giving 0.9% NaCl can exacerbate hyponatraemia in some circumstances
 How much water do you have to drink to cause hyponatraemia
 Why most patients on furosemide should also have restricted water intake
 Why a “tea and toast” diet causes hyponatraemia
 Why limiting dietary solute intake can help in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus  Physicists may still be searching for the grand unified theory of everything, but nephrologists have come pretty close to a unified theory of urine.</description>

 A general approach to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus   When is a tractor not a tractor?
…
When it turns into a field
  Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus Nephrologists are often asked for advice on how to manage patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Almost always, this has been caused by current or historic lithium exposure.
This is one of those referrals that invariably sends me scuttling back to review original literature, because I can never quite remember how on earth diuretics are supposed to magically transform into anti-diuretics in this context, nor the relative merits of thiazides / amiloride / acetazolamide.</description>

      <description>In this post…  What to do when everything is low
 Refeeding syndrome
 Acquired Bartter syndrome  One referral that is always a bit of a head-scratcher is the patient with low Na, low K, low Mg, low PO4 - what could reasonably be called pan-hypo-electrolytes. This is a pretty common scenario in hospitalised patients - and we’ll come to the differential diagnosis in a subsequent post.</description>

      <description>In this post…  The evolution of the vasopressin system
 How can one hormone regulate two physiological parameters (tonicity and blood pressure)?
 Why does terlipressin not always cause profound hyponatraemia?   “Thousands have lived without love, not one without water.”
— WH Auden
  Does terlipressin cause hyponatraemia? We had a patient with hepatorenal syndrome on the unit recently. Her sodium was 125 mM and I found myself wondering - as I always do in such a patient - whether terlipressin could be contributing.</description>
