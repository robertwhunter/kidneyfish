      <description>In this post…  What effect do loop diuretics have on renal free water clearance?
 Should we stop furosemide in hyponatraemia?
 Why do we need to restrict water intake when giving furosemide in hyponatraemia?  We are mostly water and rapidly run into trouble when we become under- or over-hydrated. We could argue, therefore, that one of the kidney’s most important jobs is that of maintaining water homeostasis.</description>
