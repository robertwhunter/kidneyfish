      <description>In this post…  The evolution of the vasopressin system
 How can one hormone regulate two physiological parameters (tonicity and blood pressure)?
 Why does terlipressin not always cause profound hyponatraemia?   “Thousands have lived without love, not one without water.”

— Marie Curie
 As facts become established dogma, it becomes almost impossible to conceive of a time when they were not known.</description>
